"""Run the port's voxel generators on the tree rebuilt from the ROM.

The generator scripts ship with the release (payload/voxelgen/, the same files
as 3ds_port/scripts in the source tree), with the rebuilt tree as their
repository root. Their outputs must match the CRCs the release was built with;
anything else would be a different game data set than the executable expects.

The steps, their order, the copy of the scripts into the tree and the output
checks are shared. Only the way one step is run differs:

* `run_step_subprocess` runs each script in its own process (desktop and the
  frozen Windows builder): no state can carry over between scripts. No
  script reads another's output, so their processes run side by side, as
  many at once as there are processors: the build takes as long as the
  slowest (the relief), not the sum;
* `run_step_inprocess` runs each script in this interpreter (the web builder:
  Pyodide has no processes). It gives every script a fresh copy of its sibling
  modules, its own argv, working directory and import path, and puts them all
  back afterwards, so a script sees the same clean start as in a new process.

Both run the scripts' own `main()` through their `__main__` guard, so the
command-line scripts keep working unchanged and no generator logic is copied.
